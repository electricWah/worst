# The Worst Programming Language

Worst is a simple, malleable programming language
built for extensibility and creativity.
Its syntax system allows you to redefine the entire language as you go.

Full documentation is available on
[the Worst homepage](http://worst.mitten.party).

## Setup

First, install [Racket](https://racket-lang.org/) (tested on version 7.2).
Then run:
```sh
# Install remaining dependencies
make deps
# Compile the interpreter
make rworst
```

Run `./worsti` to open the interactive interpreter.
