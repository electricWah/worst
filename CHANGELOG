# 0.4

- Types no longer exist as a Worst-level concept
- No more ImplValue or `impl_value!`, use `impl Value for YourType {}` instead
- Equality and value->string are now dispatch definitions, not meta values
- Val is no longer PartialEq or Debug (a consequence of removing types)
- More builtins consume their arguments: list-length, place-get
- Rename get-environment-variable -> environment-variable, now consumes
- Add list-iter builtin

# 0.3 (2022-09-25)

- Lexical scope is the true default now
- Dynamic values:
- - Add a separate dynamic scope namespace for dynamic values
- - Add dynamic-set and dynamic-resolve builtins
- - Add define (dynamic) for dynamic definitions
- - Add a definition-attributes dynamic value
      (true in the attributes clause of a define form)
- standard-worst-prompt is dynamic
- Add call-stack-dump to show debug information
- Simplify doc builtins: value-doc, value-doc-set; doc is now in worst
- Fix a bug where uplevel-ing through an empty stack frame
    would ignore its paused children
- Add ', clone2, and equal
- Remove call (eval calls symbols now)
- Start a changelog
