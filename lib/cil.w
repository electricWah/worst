; CIL 
; Codegen Instruction Language
; Compiler/Interpreter Library
; Cornish Intermediate Linguini

; Write Worst programs that can turn themselves into other languages.

; You probably won't use CIL directly unless you are writing a target for it.
; It mostly takes the form of a handful of Lua modules that aid in running
; and emitting code, and an evaluator to wrap the whole deal up neatly.
